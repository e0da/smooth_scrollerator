# Smooth Scrollerator #

It seems the author of this extension lost interest in maintaining it and even pulled it from the Chrome Web Store! Well, before he did that, he open sourced it with the MIT license. So here's my fork.

## Improvements ##

### To do ###

- Fix the console pollution bug.
- Disable middle mouse button auto scroll behavior by default.

### Done ###

- Revived the project. :)
