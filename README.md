# Smooth Scrollerator #

Scroll smoothly in Chrome.

## History ##

For unknown reasons, the original version of this extension made by
Balazs Galambosi no longer available in the Chrome Web Store.
Fortunately, it's open source and MIT licensed, so I have forked it and
will be updating it.

## Improvements ##

### To do ###

- Ground up rewrite in CoffeeScript
- Implement options page

### Done ###

- Revived the project. :)
- Fix the console pollution bug.
- Disable middle mouse button auto scroll behavior by default.
- Removed skeezy iicdn marketing bullshit! Not cool. This may be why the
  original extension disappeared from the Web Store. I'm glad I found
  it.
